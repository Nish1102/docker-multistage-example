This Dockerfile sets up multiple stages:
Stage 1 (react-build): Installs dependencies for the React.js app, builds the React.js app.
Stage 2 (java-build): Sets up Java and compiles Java code.
Stage 3 (php-build): Sets up PHP environment and copies PHP code.
Stage 4: Creates the final image. Copies built React.js files, Java compiled files, and PHP files from the previous stages. 
This stage should set up any additional configurations required for your application and define the command to run it.
Replace "your_main_node_js_file.js" with the main file for yourNode.js application.
Make sure to replace "Main.java" with the main file for your Java application, and update PHP configurations as needed.
Also, don't forget to adjust this Dockerfile according to your project structure and dependencies.
